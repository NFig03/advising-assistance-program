# Advising Assistance Program 💻💁
## Overview:
The advising assistance program makes the process of identifying course progression far more efficient. The program also streamlines the process of finding individual courses and associated information. It reads course information from a CSV file including the course number, course name, and prerequisites (if there are any). The program creates course objects based on the input, stores them in nodes, enters them into a binary search tree, and allows users to interact with the data through various menu options. 
## Features:
  - Load course data from a CSV file
  - Create and store course objects in a binary search tree
  - Print the entire course list sorted alphanumerically
  - Retrieve and print information for individual courses by their number
## Menu Options:
  1. Load Data Structure (prompts the user for the input file, creates course objects, adds each course to a dedicated node, enters each node into the tree)
  2. Print Course List (outputs the course list alphanumerically due to utilizing an in-order-traversal, prompts an error message if the data structure has not been loaded)
  3. Print Course (prompts the user for the course number to output its data, prompts an error message if the data structure has not been loaded)
  9. Exit (Terminates the program)
