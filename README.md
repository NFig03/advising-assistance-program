# advising-assistance-program

The problem I intended to solve with this project was helping ABC University computer science advisors access the course information for their students.

I approached the problem by first creating pseudocode for various potential data structures. I then proceeded to evaluate the time complexities for these data structures. With this information, I was able to make an educated decision as to what data structure I would like to use to solve the problem at hand. I finished with developing the final deliverable for the advisors. Data structures are important to understand as they each have their own advantages and disadvantages within various circumstances. 

I did encounter various roadblocks throughout the process of completing this project. Some of these roadblocks include the software not properly reading in the course content as well as loops not entering or exiting properly. To resolve these issues, I placed various print statements throughout the program so I could see exactly how far the program would get before not performing the desired functionality. I also did some research on the numerous error codes that I received not only to fix the program, but also to learn from these mistakes. 

My work on this project has expanded my approach to designing software and developing programs by encouraging me to do more preparation work prior to beginning the coding process. This has been the longest program I have developed so far into my career, however it was also the most seamless experience. I attribute this seamlessness to the pseudocode I wrote prior to beginning coding.

My work on this project evolved the way I write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable, by encouraging me to create more modular code. More modular code leads to more adaptable code as well as code that is easier to maintain. Simply removing a nested function call can greatly assist me in discovering where my problems are within my program.
